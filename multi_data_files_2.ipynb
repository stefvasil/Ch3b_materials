    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# calculate the mean RT across all participantID\n",
    "```\n",

    "Copilot generated two possible lines of code in response to the prompt, which we can see by typing `Option-[` (Mac) or `Alt-[` (Windows). The options are:\n",

    "```\n",

    "Rather than trying either of these, let's first analyze them to try to understand what each is doing. The first option uses the `groupby` method to group the data by the `participantID` column, and then calculates the mean for each group. However, we don't want to calculate the mean for each group, we want to calculate the mean for all groups. Secondly, the command does not specify that we want the mean only for the reaction time column.\n",

    "The second option is essentially the same command, except it's an improvement in that it does specify the column name `[\"RT\"]`. However, it still calculates the mean for each group, rather than for all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we could use Copilot Chat again, but it might be more efficient to try writing the code ourselves, by adapting the second Copilot suggestion. The command is an example of **chaining**, in which several methods are applied in sequence to the same object. In this case, the object is the DataFrame `df`, and the methods are `.groupby()` and `.mean()`, which would be executed in sequence, from left to right. So what if we simply remove the `.groupby()` method? Let's try that; we'll copy and past the command (and its comment) into the code cell below, and then edit it. We need to be sure to keep the `[\"RT\"]` part though!"

    "This is a frightening example of a Copilot **hallucination**. The above code generates a table of numbers, one for each participantID.  You might think this is a plausible result. However, there are a couple of problems. Firstly, confidence intervals (CIs) are typically reported as a pair of values. The 95% CIs reflect the *range* within which it is 95% likely that the true mean lies, so we need an upper *and* lower limits of the CI. These are typically the same amount plus or minus the mean (e.g., if the mean is 2, the 95% CIs might be 1.5 and 2.5). So given a conceptual understanding of what CIs are, we recognize that we need to modify the code to generate the upper and lower values of the CIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, if you look back at the mean RT for each participant, they were in the range of .339 – .449 (i.e., 339–449 ms). Again, confidence intervals reflect the range of possible true values for the mean, given the sample data. So for our confidence intervals to have values around 5 s seems implausible, given the mean RTs are < 500 ms. We would expect the CIs to be perhaps 100-200 ms. So it seems like Copilot is calculating the CIs incorrectly.\n",

This will make it easier for Copilot to generate code that does what we want. In contrast, the above prompt that we wrote, which didn't generate the correct output, was a single step simply asking for 95% CIs. Sometimes we can get away with such simple prompts, but when they fail, we can try to break down the task into a sequence of steps, and then write prompts for each step.
