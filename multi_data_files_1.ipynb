You can determine what the columns are by looking at the first row (header) of each file.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, you have to get used to the flow of working with Copilot. Copilot encourages a good coding style, and so it will sometimes only generate code if you hit `Enter` twice, so that there's an empty line between your prompt and the code.

    "Although we intended to only read and combine the data files, after I typed the first two lines of the prompt and hit `Enter`, Copilot added a third suggested line to the prompt after I hit `Enter` the first time, which was to `write the dataframe to a csv file`. This is pretty cool, since that was also part of the instructions above! Is Copilot a mind-reader? No, it's just a very good predictor of what you might want to do next, based on the prompt you've written. It's a pretty common task in data science to read in a set of individual data files, concatenate them into a single DataFrame, and then save that DataFrame to a file for later use. So, Copilot is just doing what it's trained to do, which is to predict what you might want to do next, based on the prompt you've written."

The most important parts are the last line, which tells you what the error is, and the first lines, which usually indicate what line in the code you tried to run caused the error. What's in between is the *stack trace*, which is a list of all the functions that were called in the process of trying to run the code. But most of the time, the error is a result of the code you wrote (the first lines), not the code in the underlying Python functions that your code called (the middle lines).\n",

    "You can think of a pandas DataFrame as a dictionary in which the column names are keys, and the values in that column are its values. This is a common way that pandas functions refer to column names and their values.
