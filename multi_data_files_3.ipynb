    "\n",
    "As you've seen, the process of using AI to generate code isn't always smooth, nor are the results always accurate. It's critical to critically assess the outputs you see, and to understand what you are asking Copilot to do — as well as what the code it generates is doing. In this lesson, for the sake of expediency and length we did not provide detailed explanations of what the code was doing every step of the way. However, you've seen that Copilot can be useful at explaining code for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were also many points in this lesson where, as an experienced coder, I knew what the problem was and how to fix it. However, I deliberately did not fix the problems myself, because I recognize that as a novice coder you may not know how to fix the problems. Hopefully this lesson has shown you how to use Copilot effectively, but also underscored the value of actually knowing Python and being able to read and debug code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach to learning to use Python for data science is to write code yourself when you can,  because this helps build and reinforce your knowledge (remember, coding is a procedural skill that you only learn by doing — and you lose the knowledge if you don't use it). But, when you encounter a problem you've never solved before, or are getting errors in your Code, Copilot can be a huge help to deepen your knowledge and solve problems. As we've seen, Copilot Chat can be much more useful in this regard than simply writing prompts in code cells of your notebook, because it gives you both code, and detailed explanations of what that code is doing.
